Pomodoro Timer
Pomodoro Timer is a simple Python application built using the Tkinter library to help users manage their work and break intervals effectively using the Pomodoro Technique.

How It Works
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. After a certain number of work intervals, a longer break is taken.

This Pomodoro Timer application allows users to:

Set customizable work, short break, and long break durations.
Start and stop the timer for each interval.
Reset the timer at any time.
Keep track of completed work sessions with checkmarks.
Usage
Installation:
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python installed.
Run the Application:
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command in your terminal:
python pomodoro_timer.py

Using the Timer:
Click the "Start" button to begin the work session.
The timer will count down the work duration, followed by short breaks and long breaks as per the Pomodoro Technique.
Click the "Reset" button to stop the current timer and reset it to the default state.
Customization:
You can customize the work, short break, and long break durations by modifying the constants WORK_MIN, SHORT_BREAK_MIN, and LONG_BREAK_MIN in the code.
